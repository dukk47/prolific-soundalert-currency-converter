# Prolific SoundAlert & Currency Converter

Enhance your experience on Prolific with the Prolific SoundAlert & Currency Converter, a Tampermonkey script designed to provide real-time sound notifications for new studies and a handy currency conversion tool.

## Features

- **Sound Alerts**: Receive audio notifications when new studies are available on Prolific. Easily toggle sound alerts on and off directly from the Prolific interface. (See GIF below for a demonstration.)
- **Ignore Function**: Choose to ignore specific studies. Once ignored, these studies won't trigger sound alerts, reducing unnecessary interruptions.
- **Currency Conversion**: Easily convert the displayed currency of study rewards between GBP, EUR, and USD. (See GIF below for a demonstration.)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Tampermonkey installed in your browser. If not, you can install it from [Tampermonkey's official website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Open the script file [here](https://github.com/dukk47/prolific-soundalert-currency-converter/raw/main/prolific-soundalert-currency-converter.user.js).
3. Tampermonkey should recognize the script and prompt you to install it. Click `Install`.
4. The script will now run automatically when you visit Prolific.

## Usage

- **Managing Sound Alerts**: Use the sound icon in the Prolific interface to toggle sound notifications on or off as needed. ![Sound Alert Demo](https://github.com/dukk47/prolific-soundalert-currency-converter/blob/main/demo-gifs/sound-alert-demo.gif)
- **Ignoring Studies**: Use the Ignore/Unignore buttons added to each study listing. Ignoring a study prevents sound alerts for that specific study, allowing you to focus on studies you're interested in. ![Ignore Demo](https://github.com/dukk47/prolific-soundalert-currency-converter/blob/main/demo-gifs/ignore-demo.gif)
- **Currency Conversion**: Change the currency display by selecting your preferred currency from the added currency buttons. ![Currency Conversion GIF]([URL_to_currency_conversion_gif](https://github.com/dukk47/prolific-soundalert-currency-converter/blob/main/currency_demo.gif)) ![Currency Conversion GIF]([URL_to_currency_conversion_gif](https://github.com/dukk47/prolific-soundalert-currency-converter/blob/main/currency_1_demo.gif))
